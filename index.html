<p>The Last of Us Part II is an upcoming third-person action-adventure survival horror video game being developed by Naughty Dog and will be published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4.
<br>The game acts as a sequel to The Last of Us and picks up the story of Ellie and Joel approximately five years after the events of the last game.
<br>The Last of Us Part II takes place approximately five years after the original, about 25 years after the outbreak of the Cordyceps Brain Infection began, and will feature the return of a 19-year-old Ellie, who players will assume control of, as well as Joel in his mid-fifties. Ellie is fueled by hate, which will be a major theme within the story.

<p>The Nintendo Switch[b] is the seventh major home video game console developed by Nintendo. Originally known in development as the NX, it was officially unveiled in October 2016, and was released worldwide on March 3, 2017.
<br>Nintendo considered the Switch a "hybrid" console. It is designed primarily as a home console, with the main unit inserted onto a docking station to connect to a television. Alternatively, it can be removed from the dock and used similarly to a tablet computer through its LCD touchscreen, or placed in a standalone tabletop mode playable by several people.
